I plan to rewrite it later. It's a proof of concept__\r\n\r\n# Goal\r\nI just want something that I can use during presentations on Git. So as I run commands, it'll show the git graph in a beautiful manner.\r\n\r\n# Next steps\r\n* Need to allow you to select a repository to point at. It's currently hard coded.\r\n* I need to add local and remote branch annotations.\r\n\r\n# Development\r\nIf you would like to contribute, I would love to have your contributions! All I ask is try to follow the existing conventions. There's a team ReSharper file with the current conventions.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering why the unit tests are structured as they are, read my blog post about [structuring unit tests](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/01/01/structuring-unit-tests.aspx).\r\n\r\n# License\r\n[MIT License](https://github.com/Haacked/SeeGit/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n\r\n* [LibGit2Sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) - [License: MIT](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp/blob/master/LICENSE.md) LibGit2Sharp is an thin .Net layer (well.. we try to keep it as thin as possible :-) ) wrapping the libgit2 linkable C Git library.\r\n\r\n* [QuickGraph](http://quickgraph.codeplex.com/) - [License: Ms-PL](http://quickgraph.codeplex.com/license) QuickGraph provides generic directed/undirected graph datastructures and algorithms for .NET. \r\n* [GraphSharp](http://graphsharp.codeplex.com/) - [License: Ms-PL](http://graphsharp.codeplex.com/) Graph# is a graph layout framework.
